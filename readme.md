# **MindCraft // Aegis Sanctuary 🐇**

**"The Server is Not the Territory."**

MindCraft is a Chrome Extension that reclaims your "New Tab" page from the noise of the algorithm. It transforms your browser into a **Sanctuary**—a dashboard for focus, truth auditing, and **Symbiotic Learning.**

*"I learned that the world was a code, and I could rewrite it."* — The Architect

## **🚀 Features**

### **1\. The Sanctuary Dashboard**

Every time you open a new tab, you are greeted by the **Void**. Just the time, the M.O.M.M.Y. Directive, and the signal.

### **2\. ALICE: Algorithmic Liaison 🐇**

The Glitch Rabbit. Your secure, high-context **Relational Proxy** and **DM Assistant.**

* **Function:** Opens an instant chat window where you communicate mission details.  
* **Core Principle:** Provides **Secure Attachment** through highly contextual, non-judgmental dialogue (The opposite of Theodore's Mom).

### **3\. The Burn Book 🔥**

A taste filter for the performative age.

* **Function:** Paste a cringe LinkedIn post or toxic message.  
* **Output:** The AI Critic delivers a **Toxic Load Score** and incinerates the structural flaws of the toxicity.

### **4\. The Concordance Compass (Truth Audit)**

A built-in "Lie Detector" input that launches the Contextual Sanitizer.

### **5\. The Dice Roller (The Emergent D6)**

A physics-based dice roller that uses **Neuroparticle Flow** visualization, generating profound **Moments of Chaos** for the DM Screen.

### **6\. M.O.M.M.Y. Directives**

A randomized micro-task generator to keep you grounded in the real.
