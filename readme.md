# **MindCraft // Aegis Sanctuary 🦊**

**"The Server is Not the Territory."**

MindCraft is a Chrome Extension that reclaims your "New Tab" page from the noise of the algorithm. It transforms your browser into a **Sanctuary**—a dashboard for focus, truth auditing, and mild behavioral modification.

*"I learned that the world was a code, and I could rewrite it."* — The Architect

## **🚀 Features**

### **1\. The Sanctuary Dashboard**

Every time you open a new tab, you are greeted by the **Void**. No ads. No news feed. Just the time, the stars, and the signal.

### **2\. M.O.M.M.Y. Directives (Protocol VELVET)**

A randomized micro-task generator to keep you grounded.

* *"Drink water."*  
* *"Check your posture."*  
* *"Focus on the signal."*

### **3\. The Concordance Compass (Truth Audit)**

A built-in "Lie Detector" input.

* Paste a gaslighting email or a confusing headline.  
* Click the Eye 👁️.  
* The extension copies the text and launches the **Contextual Sanitizer** to audit the disparity.

### **4\. The Glitch Fox 🦊**

Your guardian in the server room.

* Click the Fox for a status update.  
* **Warning:** Occasionally, **Frizzlebot** (The Chaos Chef) may appear to offer you Explosive Marmalade. Proceed with caution.
